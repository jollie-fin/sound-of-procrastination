This golang project implements rudimentary modular music synthesis

Run it with :

```bash
go run main.go output.wav

```

## Goals

This project was, first and foremost, a way to teach myself Golang with its
special approach to thread and communication

I see a parallel between Go's channels and wire in a modular synthesis. They both transmit a signal between A and B, that is produced on one side, and consummed on the other
